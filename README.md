# iCloudTabs for LaunchBar

This LaunchBar extension retrieves iCloud tabs from the local `~/Library/SyncedPreferences/com.apple.Safari.plist` file for all connected iCloud devices and displays the links.  Tabs from current device are excluded.

It is not the most elegant solution, but it does work. Hopefully LaunchBar with integrate with iCloud Tabs in a future release.
